# Linear Gravity Waves Problem

## Problem Setup

## Analysis Scripts

Jupyter notebooks (using Yt) are included in `analysis/`.

* 

Python scripts in `analysis/`

* `quick_2d_movie.py` script which takes command line args to produce a movie for a time-series of plotfiles. See  `python quick_2d_movie.py  -h` for help.

There is also `prep_visit.sh` which encapsulates a useful command for processing a series of plotfiles into something visit can treat as a time-series (if you are into that sort of thing).
